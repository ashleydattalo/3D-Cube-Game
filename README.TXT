PROJECT TITLE: 3D Rectangle Game

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: In Java, I know how to use the Graphics class to draw a rectangle and a line. A cube is simply two rectangles connected by four lines. So one day I decided to apply this principle to draw a cube in a Java Applet. I then added a feature allowing you to click the cube and drag it across the screen. 

*This project transformed into an idea for a game where you are given a giant cube and multiple small 3D rectangles. Then, the point of the game would be to populate the cube with the given rectangles. 

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Clone this repository onto your computer and then click run applet on CubeDriver.java

Side Note: This project is still in progress, as of right now you can only click a cube and drag it around the screen.  

Why is this project cool?:
-attention to pixels
-itâ€™s in 3D!
-shows geometry really is important!
