PROJECT TITLE: 3D Rectangle Game

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: One day an idea came to me that I should make a project where I created 3D Rectangles by drawing two rectangles, and then draw lines to connect the rectangles. 

*This transformed into an idea of a game where you have a giant cube, and you are given smaller 3D rectangles. Then, the point of the game is to populate the cube with the given rectangles. 

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Clone this repository onto your computer and then click run applet on CubeDriver.java

Side Note: This project is still in progress, as of right now you can click a cube and drag it around the screen.  

Why is this project cool?:
-attention to pixels
-itâ€™s in 3D!
-shows geometry really is important!
